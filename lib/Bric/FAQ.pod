=head2 Evaluating Bricolage

This section answers questions that someone evaluating
Bricolage might have.

=item Does Bricolage support databases other than PostgreSQL?

Currently only PostgreSQL support is maintained. There is
an Oracle driver, but it's old and not known to work. David
says there is also a MySQL driver somewhere, though I don't
see it in the sources.

Many people have asked whether Bricolage will support
MySQL. The problem used to be that MySQL didn't support
transactions; now it can, but there is no support in
Bricolage for it yet. Patches are welcome.

=item How well does Bricolage perform?

I dunno. [compare to mod_perl, CGI, static, other CMSs ... ?]

=item How does Bricolage compare to other content management systems?

It has received praise for being as good as or better than
commercial alternatives. For example, see
