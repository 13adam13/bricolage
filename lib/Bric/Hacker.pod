=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document is designed to provide information useful to Bricolage
developers. If you've got questions about hacking Bricolage that aren't
answered here please post to the Bricolage developer's mailing-list (see
below) and tell us about it.

=head1 MAILING LISTS

Bricolage has a number of mailing-lists that are relevant to developers:

=over 4

=item bricolage-general@lists.sourceforge.net

This is the mailing-list for normal Bricolage users.  This is a good
place to go with questions about how the application works and should
work.  To subscribe go to:

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/bricolage-general

=item bricolage-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

This is the place to discuss Bricolage development, propose changes,
post patches and penetrate markets.  To subscribe go to:

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/bricolage-devel

=item bricolage-commits@lists.sourceforge.net

This list gets an email for every commit to the Subversion tree (see below for
more about Subversion). B<DO NOT POST TO THIS LIST!> To subscribe:

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/bricolage-commits

=item bricolage-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net

This list gets an email for every bug-report submitted to Bugzilla
(see below for Bugzilla details).  B<DO NOT POST TO THIS LIST!> To
subscribe:

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/bricolage-bugs

=back

=head1 IRC

You can often find folks hanging out and occasionally discussing development
issues on the #bricolage channel on the Rhizomatic IRC network.

=head1 SUBVERSION

If you're developing Bricolage then you should be working with the latest code
from the Bricolage Subversion repository. You can browse the Subversion
repository at L<http://svn.bricolage.cc/viewcvs/>.

Information on connecting to the repository to checkout a working copy is at
L<http://www.bricolage.cc/svn.html>.

=head1 BUG TRACKING

Bricolage has a Bugzilla server dedicated to it:

   http://bugzilla.bricolage.cc/

You should use this system to report bugs in Bricolage. If you're looking for
something to do you can also use the system to find open bugs and fix them. For
more things to do see L<Bric::ToDo|Bric::ToDo>.

=begin comment

To generate documentation that features private method documentation, use
Pod::Perldoc from CPAN to generate HTML files:

  perldoc -MPod::Simple::HTML -w accept_targets:private lib/Bric.pm

=end comment

=head1 SUBMITTING PATCHES

Patches should be generated using the C<svn diff> command on each of the
files modified, from the root directory. For example, if you made changes to
F<lib/Bric/Changes.pod> and F<comp/foo.mc>, you would generate a diff by
running this command from the root of your Subversion checkout:

  svn diff lib/Bric/Changes.pod comp/foo.mc > patch.txt

If you created one or more new files in your changes then you'll have to add
them to the patch separately using normal C<diff> against C</dev/null>. For
example, if you created the file C<inst/upgrade/1.9.1/solve_fermat.pl> then
you would add this to patch.txt with:

  diff -u /dev/null inst/upgrade/1.9.1/solve_fermat.pl >> patch.txt

Always create patches using an up-to-date Subversion checkout if possible.
Send your patches to the bricolage-devel list mentioned above.

=head1 APPLYING PATCHES

Patches created using the method above can be applied using C<patch> with the
C<-p0> option from the root of your Subvesion checkout:

  patch -p0 < patch.txt

Make sure you check the results with C<svn diff> before committing.

=head1 CODING STANDARDS

=head2 Perl

Try to follow the style of the existing Bricolage code. Except where it is
bad, of course. Basically, write in the style you see in most Perl books and
documentation, particularly L<perlstyle>.

Although historically the Bricolage code has not enforced whitespace rules,
we now request that you use 4-space indents (2 spaces for continued lines)
and discourage the use of tabs. The following settings for some of the more
popular editors are thus recommended while editing Bricolage source code.

=head3 Emacs

We strongly recommend that you use C<cperl-mode> while editing Bricolage
sources in Emacs. Grab the latest version from the CPAN, install it, and then
place the following in your C<~/.emacs> file:

  (custom-set-variables
   '(case-fold-search t)
   '(cperl-indent-level 4)
   '(cperl-continued-statement-offset 2)
   '(cperl-tab-always-indent t)
   '(indent-tabs-mode nil))
   ;; let hashes indent normally; I think this requires
   ;; at least version 4.32 of cperl-mode.el
   '(cperl-indent-parens-as-block t)
   '(cperl-close-paren-offset -4)

Also, if you'd like to take advantage of the full functionality of
C<cperl-mode> and have it automatically parse all Perl source files, add these
settings, as well:

  (defalias 'perl-mode 'cperl-mode)
  (setq auto-mode-alist
        (append
         '(("\\.\\([pP]\\([Llm]\\|erl\\)\\|al\\|pod\\)\\'" . cperl-mode))
         auto-mode-alist))
    (setq cperl-hairy t)
    (setq interpreter-mode-alist (append interpreter-mode-alist
       '(("miniperl" . cperl-mode))))

When editing Bricolage Mason components, C<mmm-mode> can help. It's Mason mode
will parse Mason component files and use C<sgml-mode> in HTML spaces and
C<cperl-mode> in Mason blocks. Grab it from
L<http://mmm-mode.sourceforge.net/>, install it, and then add the following to
your C<~/.emacs> file to have it automatically parse your Bricolage Mason
component files:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp")
  (require 'mmm-mode)
  (require 'mmm-mason)
  (setq mmm-global-mode 'maybe)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/usr/local/bricolage/comp" . sgml-mode))
  (mmm-add-mode-ext-class 'sgml-mode "/usr/local/bricolage/comp" 'mason)

And if you need to examine the Mason object files created by Bricolage in
order to chase down bugs and such, you can use the C<cperl-mode> in those
files by adding this to your C<~/.emacs> file:

  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/usr/local/bricolage/data/obj" . cperl-mode))

=head3 Vim

Rafael Garcia-Suarez has written a Vim indent macro which (for the most
part) duplicates the behavior of Emacs C<perl-mode>.  It is now, as of Vim
6.0, included in the Vim distribution and should be found in
C<$VIMRUNTIME/indent/perl>.  The easiest way to use it though is to place the
following line in your .vimrc:

    source $VIMRUNTIME/indent.vim

You'll also need to add these lines.

    set tabstop=8
    set softtabstop=4
    set shiftwidth=4
    set expandtab

The first three lines make Vim duplicate the behavior of Emacs in creating
the appearance of 4 space tabs with a mix of tabs and spaces.  This is
necessary for reading older Bricolage files which were written this way,
and haven't yet been re-tabbed.

The expandtab setting does the Right Thing under the new rules, in that it
doesn't use tabs at all, only spaces.

=head3 SQL

The standard for writing SQL in Bricolage is pretty straight-forward: format
the SQL in 80 columns or less, and use heredocs where possible. For example:

  my $sql = "<<    END_SQL";
      SELECT id, name, description, publish_date, cover_date, current_version,
             publish_status, active
      FROM   story
      WHERE  id = ?
      END_SQL

Also, when writing your queries, please follow the following rules with regard
to table aliases:

=over 4

=item *

Do not alias any table names in queries, unless those table names are longer
than 8 characters, or are referred to in the FROM clause more than once. Under
this rule, for example, "story" and "member" would never be aliased unless
referenced twice.

=item *

For table names over 8 characters, abbreviated aliases are acceptable provided
that they are still long enough to be informative. i.e. "st_cat" instead of
"sc" for "story_category".

=item *

For multiple links to the same table, use an alias which is long enough to be
informative, such as "story2" or "inst_2" for the second reference to "story"
or "story_instance".

=back

The reason for these rules is that single-letter aliases for queries are as
unreadable and unmaintainable as single-letter variables names. You get
halfway down the page, and you can no longer remember to what tables they
refer.

The rules above are acutally taken from O'Reilly's "Introduction to PL/SQL
Programming," which has an I<excellent> chapter on code cleanliness in SQL and
SQL-extension languages.

=head2 OTHER GOOD PRACTICES

Keep subroutines short. Each subroutine should handle one task. For example,
if you have a subroutine C<get_foo>, and getting "foo" requires getting "bar"
and "qux", then make two more subroutines C<get_bar> and C<get_qux> and put
them in the "private functions" section. Also if you duplicate some code in
several subroutines, factor it out into another subroutine. It's easier to
maintain one subroutine than to maintain three.

Limit the width of your code to 80 characters if possible. This makes them
easier to read. Keeping subroutines short helps to meet this goal, as well.

Make enough comments so that someone maintaining your code can understand what
is going on. Comments shouldn't be redundant with the code. They should
explain non-obvious code. Comments can be bad in some cases if code changes
and the corresponding comment is not kept in sync. So keep the comments in
sync!

Use Perl idioms if it is clear and concise, but use them with care.
Implicit variables can be slick, but hard to understand; add a comment
if you use uncommon ones.

Use Mason components only for display, and put business logic into library
modules and callback components. But only for as long as callbacks are in
components! We hope to move them into libraries soon, at which time this rule
will become even more rigid.

For POD, generally you copy/paste it from another module. Recently
we are trying to cut out some of useless things like
C<< BE<lt>Side Effects:E<gt> NONE >>. For a canonical example, see
C<Bric::Biz::Site>.

Avoid magic values, i.e. don't hard-code numbers into code. It tends to become
a maintenance problem if you put the number 1023 throughout a module and then
somewhere else you have 1021; is 1021 related to 1023 (1023 - 2), or is it
just another random number? And what does 1023 mean? Put a constant at the top
of the module and use that, instead.

In the end, just try to follow the existing code style, and take into
consideration any feedback you get from the mailing list when patches are
submitted.

=head1 TESTING

All Bricolage patches should be accompanied by the necessary tests. You are
strongly encouraged to write comprehensive tests that thoroughly test whatever
changes or additions you make to the Bricolage API. You are also strongly
encouraged to write tests for the current API, if you find that adequate tests
have not yet been written (and this is true in a great many places,
unfortunately). Although Bricolage does not yet support UI tests, we take our
API testing seriously, and so should you. Here's what you need to know to
write tests for Bricolage.

Bricolage contains a test suite based on L<Test::Class|Test::Class>. The test
classes live in the F<t/Bric> directory, and all subclass Bric::Test::Base. If
you're familiar with L<Test::More|Test::More>, then the syntax for how the
Test::Class-based classes work should be pretty readily apparent. See the
L<Test::Class|Test::Class> documentation for details. It's definitely worth a
read. If you haven't used Test::More, its documentation is also a must-read.

Bricolage has two different sets of tests, those run by C<make test> and those
run by C<make devtest>. The former are stand-alone tests that don't rely on the
presence of a Bricolage database to be run. They can thus be run before
C<make install>. The idea here is that we offer a basic set of tests that can
be run via the standard Perl installation pattern of

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The tests run by <make devtest> are intended to be run during development.
They require that a Bricolage database be installed and running. They will
C<SELECT>, C<INSERT>, C<UPDATE>, and C<DELETE> data from that database, so
C<make devtest> should B<never> be run against a production database. Indeed,
you should in general have a clean, fresh database installation to run the
tests against. Although the test suite makes every effort to clean up after
itself by C<DELETE>ing data it has added to the database, it is unfortunately
imperfect, and extra data will be left, especially in Group-related and
Attribute-related tables.

So, once more, C<make devtest> should B<never> be run against a production
database. 'Nuff said.

You can get a clean database without reinstalling Bricolage by doing

  sudo make db
  sudo make db_grant

Answer yes when it asks you to drop the database. Then to get useful
debugging output, do verbose testing with something like

  sudo make devtest TEST_VERBOSE=1 > test.out 2>&1

All of the tests are run by the F<inst/runtests.pl> script, which in turn
tells L<Test::Harness|Test::Harness> to execute F<t/Bric/Test/Runner.pm>. This
file will find all the necessary test classes, load them, and then run their
tests. F<inst/runtests.pl> takes a number of arguments to simplify the running
of scripts, including a list of test files or classes to run, so that you can
just run the tests you need to run while you're developing new tests.
C<perldoc inst/runtests.pl> for more information.

Be sure to use the testing base classes in your test classes. For non-database
dependent tests (which are always in files named F<Test.pm>, use
L<Bric::Test::Base|Bric::Test::Base>. For development tests, use
L<Bric::Test::DevBase|Bric::Test::DevBase>, which inherits from
Bric::Test::Base. Be sure to read the documentation in these classes, as it
will help you to write your tests more effectively. Pay special attention to
the methods added to Bric::Test::DevBase, as they're there to help you clean
up any new records you've added to the database.

And finally, when you do provide patches to Bricolage, along with the new
tests to test them, make sure that all I<existing> tests pass, as well. This
means that you should always run C<make devtest> on a fresh database build
with your changes. Furthermore, if your patch involves changes to the
database, you should provide the necessary upgrade script in F<inst/upgrade/>,
and also run the tests against a database that has been built from Bricolage
sources untouched by your patch, and then upgraded by your upgrade
script. This will help to ensure that your upgrade script modifies the
database in the same way as your patch modifies the Bricolage SQL files.

And with that said, happy testing!

=head1 DEBUGGING

Bricolage is a complex application and debugging can be difficult.
Here are some tips to help you find bugs faster:

=over 4

=item *

Turn on C<QA_MODE> in your F<bricolage.conf> file. This will cause the UI to
display a bunch of useful data at the bottom of every page, including session
state, cache state, cookies, and GET and POST args. C<QA_MODE> turns on
PerlWarn (C<use warnings>) and causes error messages to include more
information. C<QA_MODE> also enables Apache::Status at the URL F</perl-status>
which allows you can to examine the state of the Perl interpreter inside
Apache.

=item *

Set the C<NO_TOOLBAR> directive to "0" or "Off" in F<bricolage.conf> to keep
Bricolage from popping up a new browser window without a toolbar.

=item *

Run Bricolage under the Perl debugger using the debug command with
F<bric_apachectl>:

   bric_apachectl debug

This will start Apache in single-process mode (C<httpd -X>) and setup
Apache::DB to start the debugger on the each hit to the server. You'll need to
install the Apache::DB Perl module to use this command.

To run Bricolage under DDD (L<http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/>), start ddd as
root and load F<bin/bric_apachectl>. Give it the argument "debug" and run
it. When you issue a hit to the server the debugger will stop on the first
line of C<Bric::App::Handler::handler()>. From there you can set breakpoints
inside Bricolage and debug normally.

If you prefer to run without the debugger using only the Apache single-process
mode, then run Bricolage using the command

   bric_apachectl single

=item *

Set C<DBI_DEBUG> and C<DBI_CALL_TRACE> to 1 in your F<bricolage.conf>
file. C<DBI_DEBUG> records every database call in the logs complete with SQL
and arguments. C<DBI_CALL_TRACE> adds a a subroutine call trace for each
statement showing where the database call originated. This generates a lot of
data but it can be very helpful.

=item *

Look at the database directly using F<psql>. Many bugs in Bricolage can only
be successfully diagnosed by examining records created in the database.

=back

=head1 PERFORMANCE TUNING

Bricolage has two separate profiling systems that you can use to extract
performance data:

=over 4

=item *

To run Bricolage under the Devel::Profiler module set the C<PROFILE> variable
on in your F<bricolage.conf> file and restart your server. This will create a
F<profiler/$$/tmon.out> file in your Apache log directory for each server
process. You can use F<dprofpp> to analyze these files after the server has
been stopped with C<bric_apachectl stop>. See the Devel::Profiler
documentation for more details.

=item *

The database profiler is activated by enabling the C<DBI_PROFILE> option in
F<bricolage.conf>. This causes database profiling traces to be written to the
Apache error log during requests. You can then use F<bric_dbprof> to analyze
these trace. See L<bric_dbprof> for details.

=back

B<CAUTION:> Neither of these options is appropriate for a production system.

=head1 ACTIONS AND MOVERS

A relatively simple way to contribute to Bricolage is to provide actions
and movers. These are plugin modules that can add new functionality to
Bricolage without needing to make changes to the existing API.

An "action" is an act that is performed on files before they are distributed.
Say you want to clean the HTML of all of your HTML files before they're
distributed. You'll need to create an action to do this. Consult
L<Bric::Dist::Action> for information on how to create actions.

Say you need to distribute files via a protocol that Bricolage doesn't currently
support -- say, an new variant of FTP called "FooTP." You'll need to create a
new mover. Consult L<Bric::Dist::Action::Mover> for details on how to do that.

=head1 MERGING CHANGES FROM BRANCH TO TRUNK

If you're a Bricolage developer with permission to commit to the Subversion
repository, you may occasionally have to merge changes from a release branch
(where bug fixes are generally committed) into the trunk. Here's how to do it
with a minimum of hassle.

=over 4

=item 1

Make sure that both the branch you are merging from and the trunk are updated
and have no uncommitted changes. You can check for these differences by using
the Subversion <status> and <update> commands. Running C<svn status> will tell
you if there have been any uncommitted changes to the local copy of the branch
or trunk. Running C<svn update> will merge in any updates from the copy on the
Subversion server. So we recommend runing both of these commands in both the
branch and the trunk and committing any necessary chaanges before continuing.

  % cd bricolage-trunk
  % svn status
  % svn update
  At revision 6123.

  % cd bricolage-branch-checkout
  % svn status
  % svn update
  At revision 6123.

=item 2

To merge the changes from the branch into the trunk, you need to tell the
Subversion <merge> command to use the difference between two revisions in the
I<branch> to update the trunk. The two revisions to compare are, on the one
hand, either the revision when the branch was created, or the revision when
the branch was last merged into the trunk; and on the other hand, the current
revision in the branch.

For the latter number, you can simply use the C<HEAD> keyword, which
represents the latest revision number in the branch.

For the former number, we have implemented a standard way of recording a
merge: we create a new tag for the branch. In Subversion, branches and tags
are exactly the same, the difference is only in convention. So the convention
for Bricolage is to store tags in the F<tags> subdirectory of the project
directory, and branches in the F<branches> subdirectory. The other half of the
convention is that no one should ever commit changes to a tag after it has
been created.

Tags are named for the branch name, the word "merge", and the revision number
up to which the merge was made. For example, if a merge was committed to the
trunk from the rev_1_8 branch in Subversion revision # 5694, the branch would
be tagged "rev_1_8_merge_5694".

So to get the revision number of the last merge, look in the Bricolage ViewCVS
interface for the last merge tag created for the branch. Or use the Subversion
C<list> command to find it:

  % svn list http://svn.bricolage.cc/bricolage/tags | grep rev_1_8
  rev_1_8_merge_5694/
  rev_1_8_merge_5825/
  rev_1_8_merge_5902/
  rev_1_8_merge_5995/

If the branch has never been merged into the trunk you can get the revision
number at the time the branch was created usinsing C<svn log> command:

  % svn log --verbose --stop-on-copy \
    http://svn.bricolage.cc/bricolage/branches/rev_1_8
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  r5525 | theory | 2004-05-10 19:16:48 -0700 (Mon, 10 May 2004) | 1 line
  Changed paths:
     A /bricolage/branches/rev_1_8 (from /bricolage/trunk:5524)

So now we know that we want to update the trunk with all of the changes
between revision 5995 and C<HEAD>. If no merge tag exists, then use C<svn log>
to find out at what revision number the branch was created and use that
number.

=item 3

Now simply switch to the trunk checkout and perform the merge. Using the above
examples, the merge would look like this:

  % cd bricolage-trunk
  % svn merge -r 5995:HEAD http://svn.bricolage.cc/bricolage/branches/rev_1_8
  U  lib/Bric/App/ApacheConfig.pm
  C  lib/Bric/Hacker.pod

If you're nervous about doing the merge (don't be, it's just your local copy
you're updating at this point), you can use the C<--dry-run> option to see
what files would change without changing them. Or run C<svn diff> with the
same arguments to see what the differences are:

  % svn merge -r --dry-run 5995:HEAD \
    http://svn.bricolage.cc/bricolage/branches/rev_1_8 > test.diff

=item 4

Resolve any conflicts (hopefully none, but they do happen occasionally).
Notice above that the result of the merge is a conflict in
F<lib/Bric/Hacker.pod>. To resolve the conflicts, follow the directions in the
Subversion book, published online here:
L<http://svnbook.red-bean.com/svnbook/ch03s05.html#svn-ch-3-sect-4.4>.

=item 5

Rebuild the database and run all of the tests:

  % make devtest TEST_VERBOSE=1

If there are any test failures, you'll need to fix those, too.

=item 6

Commit the changes to the trunk. Be sure to specify what revisions were merged
in, and what the new tag you'll create in the branch will be named. The final
revision number (represented by HEAD) happened to have been printed out when
we ran C<svn update> in step one, so it's easy to find and use:

  % svn commit -m 'Merged rev_1_8 changes 5995-6123. Will tag rev_1_8_merge_6123.'

=item 7

Tag the branch with the last revision, so that future merges can decide to
merge only from thiat revision on.

  % svn cp http://svn.bricolage.cc/bricolage/branches/rev_1_8 \
    http://svn.bricolage.cc/bricolage/tags/rev_1_8_merge_6123 \
    -m 'Merge tag for rev_1_8 to revision 6123.'

=back

By following this methodology we should be able to minimize the number of
conflicts we get between merges. See book "Version Control with Subversion,"
chapter 4 at L<http://svnbook.red-bean.com/svnbook/ch04.html>, for a more
detailed explanation of the whys and wheres of this approach to merging
Subversion branches.

=head1 CREATING DISTRIBUTIONS

B<Note: To be updated to reflect use of Subvesion!>

If you are a Bricolage release manager and you're getting ready to release a
new version, here are the steps you'll need to take to create a distribution
tarball. First, proof-read the list of changes in Bric::Changes. Also, be sure
to add today's date to the header for the new release:

  =head1 VERSION 1.x.x (2003-11-29)

Next, tag the release in Subversion:

  svn tag rel_1_x_x

If this is a major release, you'll need to create a new branch, so that it can
be maintained for bug fixes separately, and then tag the release in that
branch.

  svn branch rev_1_x
  svn tag rel_1_x_x

Next, export the sources into a new directory. Be sure to use the C<-kkv>
option with C<export> so that the version numbers are all properly populated.

  cd /tmp
  svn export -r rel_1_x_x bricolage
  cd bricolage
  make dist

This will create a distribution tarball in the bricolage directory. Copy this
tarball somewhere, and do a full test with it, to make sure that Bricolage
does indeed build and properly install itself.

  cp bricolage-1.x.x.tar.gz /tmp/src
  cd /tmp/src
  tar zxvf bricolage-1.x.x.tar.gz
  cd bricolage-1.x.x
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  # Shut down PostgreSQL.
  make test
  # Start PostgreSQL.
  sudo make install
  make devtest
  sudo bric_apachectl start
  # Log in to the UI and test it a bit.
  sudo make uninstall

Be sure to run C<make devtest> after everything is installed to make sure that
it is all functioning correctly. Users won't be running these tests, as they
muck up the database. But that's okay for our validation of the release
tarball. Use C<make uninstall> to clean up the mess. If you have to go back
and make any changes, be sure to commit them to the Subversion repository and
then to update the tag, then do the whole thing over again. Once everything
appears to be working properly, release!

=head2 Documentation Generation

Once the new version of Bricolage has been released, you'll need to regenerate
the documentation on the Web site. There is documentation for each major
version of Bricolage. The documentation for each version is generated from the
latest minor release. So if you've just released, say, version 1.8.4, then the
documentation should be generated for the "1.8" Documentation section. If
you've just released 1.10.0, then you'll need to create a new "1.10" section
and add a link to it on the documentation page of the Web site.

The documentation is generated with the F<pod_browser> script, which is in the
"distutils" directory in Subversion. Read its instructions carefully, and then
generate the documentation on the Web server.
