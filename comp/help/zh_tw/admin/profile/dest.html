<help page="Destination Profile">

<p>This form is for editing or creating a <dfn>destination</dfn>, and gives
 information about how the destination can be used to publish content.<p>

<p>During the first stage of creating a new destination, only the first
 two sections of the form are visible.  Once they are filled in, press
 &#8216;Next&#8217; to move forward and show the rest of the form.
 The complete form is also shown when editing an existing destination.</p>


<h3>Properties</h3>

 <dd>The name of the destination.  It must be unique, but is only used
  to make it easier to distinguish different destinations.</dd>

 <dt>Description</dt>
 <dd>A fuller description of the purpose of the destination.</dd>

 <dt>Move Method</dt>
 <dd>The method used to copy the files to the destination.  The actual
  set of options available will depend on how your Bricolage installation
  is configured, but the following might be available:

  <dl>
   <dt>File System</dt>

  </dl>
 </dd>

 <dt>Copy Resources</dt>

  to a temporary directory before any &#8216;actions&#8217; are applied to
  them.</dd>

 <dt>Publishes</dt>
 <dd>If checked (which is the default and common case), this destination
  will be used for publishing finished output.</dd>

 <dt>Previews</dt>
 <dd>If checked, this destination can be used for previewing output.</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Output Channels</h3>

<p>This section is used to set the output channels for which this
 destination will be used.</p>


<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>Use this part of the form to add, edit or remove <dfn>actions</dfn>,
 which are the types of processing that output is subjected to when it is
 sent to the destination.</p>

<p>The common case is for there to be only one action, of type
 &#8216;Move&#8217;, which performs the actual copy or upload operation.</p>


<h3>Servers</h3>

<p>Use this part of the form to add, edit or remove <dfn>servers</dfn>,
 which define how output is sent to the server when it is published.
 For example, if the FTP method is being used to copy output, a username
 and password must be given for the server.</p>
