<help page="Bulk Publish">

<p>With this feature, a permitted administrator can publish all stories
or media in selected categories.</p>

<p>On the first page, use Search to narrow down the list of categories
as you normally would. Enter part of a URI and click Search. For each
of the listed categories, you can now check the checkboxes for stories
or media in any of those categories that you want to publish. Click
'Publish Checked' when you're ready to publish (or schedule publishing
in the job queue).</p>
