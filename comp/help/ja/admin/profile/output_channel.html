<p> Enter the Output Channel's name and a brief description. Enter the file name
    and extension for the stories files created in this output channel in the 
    &quot;File Name&quot; and &quot;File Extension&quot; fields.</p>

<p> The URI Format properties determine how the URIs of stories and media will
    be created in this output channel. In the &quot;URI Format&quot; and
    &quot;Fixed URI Format&quot; fields, enter the tokens that represent the
    various parts out of which the URI should be made. Tokens must be
    separated by <code>/</code>; like a URI. The currently available tokens are:</p>

<ul>
  <dl>
    <dt><code>%{categories}</code></dt>
    <dd><p>The category path.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>%{slug}</code></dt>
    <dd><p>The slug, applies to stories only.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>%Y</code></dt>
    <dd><p>The cover date year.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>%m</code></dt>
    <dd><p>The cover date month</p></dd>

    <dt><code>%d</code></dt>
    <dd><p>The cover date day.</p></dd>

    <dt>%{uuid}</dt>
    <dd><p>The document UUID.</p></dd>

    <dt>%{base64_uuid}</dt>
    <dd><p>The base64-encoded document UUID.</p></dd>

    <dt>%{hex_uuid}</dt>
    <dd><p>The hex representation of the document UUID.</p></dd>
</ul>

<p>For example, a story in the category <code>/stories</code>, whose slug
    is <code>hello</code>, with a cover date of Feb. 27, 2002 and URI
    Format <code>/%{categories}/%Y/%m/%d/%{slug}/</code> would have the
    URI <code>/stories/2002/02/27/hello/</code>. Any other DateTime-supported
    <code>strftime</code> format can be used for other parts of the cover
    date, as well. See the <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DateTime/lib/DateTime.pm#strftime_Specifiers"
    onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">DateTime documentation</a> for the
    complete list.</p>

<p> You can also use the URI format fields to set a prefix or postfix directory 
    to the URI. For example with a URI Format of 
    <code>/foo/%{categories}/%{slug}/bar/</code> and the file example above the 
    uri would be /foo/stories/hello/bar/index.html. This feature is useful if 
    you're keeping different kinds of content on one delivery server.</p>

<p> The &quot;URI Case&quot; select list forces URIs in this output channel to
    be formatted in a particular case, either &quot;Mixed Case&quot; (the
    default), &quot;Lowercase&quot;, or &quot;Uppercase&quot;.</p>

<p> The &quot;Use Slug for Filename&quot; field indicates that the names of
    the story files created in this output channel should use the slug when
    possible. This means that non-fixed stories will use the slug to name the
    file, if it's available. Fixed stories will instead use the name specified
    in the Filename field, while media will use the name of the media file
    itself.</p>

<dd>Select existing Output Channels in order to include the templates of those
    Output Channels in this Output Channel. The idea here is that, when you
    preview or publish assets via this Output Channel, if the Burn system can't
    find a template, it'll look for it in the Output Channels selected here. The
    template includes can be ordered, and they will be searched for templates in
    that order.</dd>
