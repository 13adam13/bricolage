<dt>Properties</dt>
<dd>Enter the element type's name, key name, and a brief description. The key
    name should be a unique, one-word identifier If the element type
    represents a document page or is allowed to create a relationship with a
    story or media document, select the appropriate checkbox. If the element
    type is a story type or media type, and you want it to have a fixed URI
    (usually meaning that only the category URI makes up the document URI),
    select the <q>Fixed</q> checkbox. The <q>Type</q> indicates the type of
    element type, which is one of <q>Story</q> for story types, <q>Media</q>
    for media types, or <q>Subelement</q> for subelements. Media type elements
    can also be one of three subtypes, available in a select
    list: <q>Audio,</q> <q>Image,</q> <q>Video,</q> or <q>Other
    Media.</q></dd>

<dt>Group Memberships</dt>
<dd>Groups determine the permission that users will have to read, edit, or
    create elements types of this kind. Select a group from the <q>Available
    Groups</q> list and click the <em>Add to List</em> button to add it to the
    <q>Current Groups.</q> You can remove a group from the <q>Current
    Groups</q> by selecting a group and clicking <em>Remove from List.</em> If
    you are creating a new element type, click the <em>Next</em> button to
    continue. This will bring you to the full element type profile.</dd>

<dt>Sites</dt>
<dd>Top-level element types (story and media type elements) can be shared
    among several sites. This section won't be present for non-top-level
    elements or if Bricolage manages only one site. The <q>Sites</q> section
    allows you to add or delete sites from the element. You can also select
    the primary output channel for each siteâ€”if there is more than one output
    channel.</dd>

<dt>Existing Subelements</dt>
<dd>Element types really define container elements that contain other
    elements as well as fields. To add subelements to an element type, click
    the <em>Add Subelement</em> button to bring up the <q>Choose
    Subelements</q> screen. Use the Search box as usual to select all or a
    subset of the available subelement element types. Naturally, the element
    types you can select won't include top-level elements. To add element
    types, select their corresponding <q>Add to Element Type</q> checkboxes,
    then click <em>Add Elements</em>; if you decide you don't want to add any
    subelements element types, just leave all the checkboxes unselected and
    click <em>Add Elements</em>. This will bring you back to the element type
    profile.</dd>

<dt>Custom Fields</dt>
<dd>Fields are where content is stored. Along with subelement element types,
    these define the structure of an element type. In the <q>Custom Fields</q>
    section you can edit the default value for the listed fields and reorder
    them by selecting a number from the popup menus. To edit a field, click
    the <em>Edit</em> link. This will bring you to
    the <q><a href="field_type.html" title="Field Type Profile Help">Field
    Type Profile</a>,</q> where you can change anything about the field except
    its key name Finally, to delete a field, select the <q>Delete</q> checkbox
    and click one of the <em>Save</em> buttons at the bottom of the
    screen.</dd>

<dt>Add New Field</dt>
<dd>This is where you add new fields to the Custom Fields section. First,
    choose the widget you would like to use from the group of radio buttons on
    the left. The fields required for the management of that widget will be
    displayed in the rest of this section. These fields are explained in
    detail on the <a href="field_type.html">Field Type Profile Help
    Page</a></dd>

</dl>

<p>When finished, click <em>Save</em>, or click <em>Save and Stay</em> to save
   but continue editing the Element. Clicking <em>Return</em> will bring you
   back to the <q>Element Type Manager</q> without saving your changes.</p>
