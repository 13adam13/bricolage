<help page="Bulk Edit">

<p>Use the Bulk Edit interface to edit all of the elements and subelements of
a given element at once. Different fields and elements are demarcated by lines
with special tags that start with an equals sign (<code>=</code>) and have an
empty line separating them from content; anything else is considered
content.</p>

<p>Field elements are demarcated by <code>=key_name</code> and an empty line,
where <code>key_name</code> is the the key name of the field. For example, a
field with the key name <q>paragraph</q> may be rendered as so:</p>

% # Be sure that the length of the lines will fit into the small help window
% # here and in the Roosevelt quote below.

<pre>=paragraph

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed
diam nonummy nibh eusmod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna
aliquam erat volputate. Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis
nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit lobortis nisl ut
aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
</pre>

<p>Container elements are demarcated by <code>=begin key_name</code> and an empty
line, and then an <code>=end key_name</code> tag at the end of the element.
The key name after the <code>=end</code> tag is optional. Fields within
container elements go between these tags, like so:</p>

<pre>
=begin pull_quote

    =paragraph

    1961-01-20 00:00:00

=end pull_quote
</pre>

<p>Indentation of subelements is optional, although Bricolage will generate
four-space indents for existing elements. If for some reason you must have a
content line that starts with an equal sign, escape it with a backslash, like
so:</p>

<pre>
=header

\= Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
</pre>

<p>Related stories and related media are indiciated by one of the following
tags:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>=related_story_uri</code></li>
  <li><code>=related_media_uri</code></li>
  <li><code>=related_story_url</code></li>
  <li><code>=related_media_url</code></li>
  <li><code>=related_story_uuid</code></li>
  <li><code>=related_media_uuid</code></li>
  <li><code>=related_story_id</code></li>
  <li><code>=related_media_id</code></li>
</ul>

<p> The URI, URL, UUID, or ID is then put on the same line as the tag.
Bricolage itself uses <code>_uuid</code> tags for related documents. The
<code>_uri</code> tags are probably simplest to use, but should not be used if
you manage multiple sites in Bricolage and different sites can use the same
URIs. The <code>_url</code> tags avoid this problem by using a full URL for a
related document; the domain name from the URL will be used to look up the
appropriate site. Some examples:</p>

<pre>
=related_story_url http://www.example.com/reviews/books/

=related_media_uri /reviews/movies/2005/12/14/king_kong.png
</pre>

<p>These tags will create a relationship with the story with the URI
<q>/reviews/books/</q> and associated with the site with the domain
<q>www.example.com</q>, and with the media document with the URI
<q>/reviews/movies/2005/12/14/king_kong.png</q> without regard to the site
to which it belongs.</p>

<p>Use the <q>Default Field</q> select list to assign any untagged blocks of
content to a particular field. For example, if you selected <q>paragraph</q>
as the default field, the above pull quote element can be written as:</p>

<pre>
=begin pull_quote

    Ask not what your country can do for you.
    Ask what you can do for your country.

    =by

    John F. Kennedy

    =date

    1961-01-20 00:00:00

=end pull_quote
</pre>

<p>Of course, all of these tags can be used to edit an entire hierarchy of an
element and its subelements, and this is where the default field becomes
especially useful. For example, to edit an entire story's worth of elements,
you might have something like this (again, with <q>paragraph</q> selected as
the default field):</p>

        So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that
        the only thing we have to fear is fear
        itself&#x2014;nameless, unreasoning, unjustified
        terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert
        retreat into advance.
