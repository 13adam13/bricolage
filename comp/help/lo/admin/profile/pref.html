<help page="Preference Profile">

<p>The preference profile allows you to edit the value of a single preference.
Simply edit the <q>Value</q> field as appropriate to the preference.</p>

<p>You can also allow users to set their own, personal preferences on a a
preference-by-preference basis by selecting the <q>Can be Overridden</q>
checkbox. For any preferences with this checkbox checked, users can edit their
own copy of the preference in their profiles. These user-specific settings
default to the value of the global preference set here, and affects only the
Bricolage user interface. Templates, in particular, only rely on global preference
settings (such as <q>Date / Time Format</q>).</p>

<p><strong>Group Memberships</strong> determine the permission that users will
have to edit the global values of preferences. Select a group from
the <q>Available Groups</q> list and click the <em>Add to List</em> button to
add it to the <q>Current Groups.</q> You can remove a group from
the <q>Current Groups</q> by selecting a group and clicking <em>Remove from
List.</em></p>

<p>Click <em>Save</em> to save your changes or <em>Cancel</em> to discard your
changes and return to the <q>Preference Manager.</q></p>
