<dt>Name, Description</dt>
<dd>Enter the Element Type Set's name and a brief description.</dd>

<dt>Page</dt>
<dd>Checking this checkbox makes the Element Type Set a page.
    This means that if a Story has more than one Page element,
    a separate (HTML) file will be created for each page.</dd>

<dt>Fixed</dt>
<dd>This determines whether the Element Type Set will have a fixed URL.
    This is generally used in &quot;Cover Pages&quot;, which link to several
    other pages and whose URIs shouldn't depend (for example) on the
    date that the Cover was created.</dd>

<dt>Related Story, Media</dt>
<dd>All Elements can have one story and/or one media object associated
    with them. Checking these boxes allows users to do this. </dd>

<dt>Type</dt>
<dd>The type can be either Story, Media, or Element. An element with
    a type of Story or Media is a top-level element. All other elements
    are of type Element, which can be added to other elements as
    subelements. When creating a new Element Type Set, you have to select
    the Type on the first page, as other options depend on this property.</dd>
