<help page="Element Profile">

<p>Edit story and media elements in the <q>Element Profile.</q> As with
the <q>Content</q> section of the story or media profile, you can edit the
contents of an element here, add new subelements and fields, or bulk edit the
element and all of its subelements.</p>

<p> The first section, labeled <q>Story Information</q> or <q>Media
Information,</q> contains a summary of the major attributes of the story or
media document of which the element is a part. You can also click the URI of
the story, or select an output channel from the select list and click
the <em>Preview</em> button to preview the document, which can be handy as you
work on the content of the element. The preview will only reflect the changes
as of the last time the element was saved.</p>

<p>Click <em>Save</em> to save the element and return to the parent element
or, if the parent element is the story or media element, the story or media
profile. Click <em>Save and Stay</em> to save your changes and continue
working on the element. Click <em>Cancel</em> to discard your changes and
return to the parent element. To delete the element, select the <q>Delete this
Profile</q> checkbox before clicking <em>Save.</em></p>
