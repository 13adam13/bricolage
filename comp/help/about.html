<table>

<tr><td>The name &quot;Bricolage&quot; was not draw directly from the common
usage of the term in French, but rather from the first chapter of &quot;The
Savage Mind&quot; by the famed French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss. In
that famous discussion of scientific thought vs. mythical though &#151; of
science vs. &quot;the science of the concrete&quot; &#151; Levi-Strauss
declares, &quot;Mythical thought is therefore a kind of intellectual
&#39;bricolage.&#39;&quot;
</td></tr>

<tr><td>Bricolage is the product of a bricoleur, a kind of handy-man who
assembles the fruits of his labors from the tools he has available to him.
Similarly, mythical thought uses the extant concepts available to the cultural
bricoleur to shape the world of cultural understanding. In other words, one's
understanding and interpretation of the world and its events derives from
assembling new interpretations based on existing cultural (Levi-Strauss would
say &quot;structural&quot) symbols. &quot;Signs allow and even require the
interposing and incorporation of a certain amount of human culture into
reality,&quot; Levi-Strauss writes. Thus signs (or symbols, and modern
anthropologists are more likely to call them) are the building blocks of
cultural comprehension.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>Similarly, content is assembled in the Bricolage Content Managment
System by drawing on extant elements to create a new end product. Element
administrators function as Levi-Straussian &quot;scientists&quot; in that they
create new symbols (elements) that story editors and media producers &#151; as
new media bricoleurs &#151; draw on to assemble and manage new structures of
meaning (content).
</td></tr>

<tr><td>For those who may find this explanation too much a stretch, we fall back
on the meaning of the term &quot;bricolage&quot; as it is commonly used in
English, rather than French. For our French users, who see the name and
immediately think, &quot;big hack,&quot; note that typical English definition,
according to <i>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth
Edition,</i> is simply, &quot;something made or put together using whatever
materials happen to be available.&quot; This definition nicely describes how
Bricolage content is built using the elements that are available.
