<h1>Desks</h1>
The Desks structure allows you and others at your company to share and exchange content items.
<BR><BR>
After you create and save a new item, it resides on your Workspace by default.  You can then check it in to a Desk to make it accessible to others in your company's community.  Once a user from one Desk edits and approves the item, he or she will move it to the next Desk and the process will repeat until the item is ready to be published.
<br><BR>
A Desk looks and operates a lot like your Workspace- it's just a common space version.  If a Photograph resides on the Art Desk, as an example, any user who has access to the Art Desk will have access to the Photograph, though only one at a time can edit it.

<h3>Content Item Properties (on Desks)</h3>
<blockquote> <b>Title: </b>Click to preview the item in another window (except 
  for Templates).<BR>
  <b>Category: </b>Where on the site an item is published.<BR>
  <b>Cover Date: </b>The date that will be posted with the Story. (this is not 
  necessarily the publish date, but what appears to viewers to be the publish 
  date).<BR>
  <b>Priority: </b>Tells users how urgent the item is.<BR>
  <b>Check Out: </b>Brings the item to your Workspace to be edited. When an item 
  is checked out, it is still listed on the most recent Desk and can be viewed 
  there, but may not be checked out to another user until it is first checked 
  back in to the Desk. <BR>
  <b>Check In: </b>If you see this option, it means that you have checked the 
  item out from this Desk to your Workspace. To let another user access and edit 
  the item, you'll need to click this button and check it back in to the Desk. 
  <BR>
  <b>Move to (pull down): </b>This moves the item to another Desk. Select the 
  desired Desk, scroll to the bottom of the page and click Move Assets. You can 
  move more than one item at a time. In addition, you can move an item from one 
  Desk to another even if it is checked out to a user. The item will remain checked 
  out at its new desk.<BR>
  <b>Notes: </b>View any editorial notes users have attached to the item.<BR>
  <b>Trail:</b> Lists what Desks the item has been checked in to.<BR>
  <b>Edit:</b> This option will only appear to you if the item is checked out 
  to your Workspace.<BR>
  <b>Log: </b>Displays the item's history of actions.</blockquote>
