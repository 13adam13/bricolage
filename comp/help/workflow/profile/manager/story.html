<h2>Find Story</h2>

  a title, URL or keyword and click Search. For a complete list of Stories, leave 
  the space blank and click Search. <BR>
  <BR>
  <b>Advanced Search: </b>This search allows you to be more specific about what 
  Stories you're trying to find. Fill in any or all of the fields and click Search. 
  To restart your search with a fresh page, click Clear Values. <BR>

  <b>Stories Found: </b>Click View next to the desired Story to view its profile.  If the Story is not checked out to another user, you can fill in the Checkout box and click the Checkout button at the bottom of the page to move it to your Workspace.

  <b>Create a New Story:</b> If you can't find what you need in the existing Stories,
