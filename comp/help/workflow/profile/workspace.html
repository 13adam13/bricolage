<h1>My Workspace</h1>
This is your home base. Here you will store all the content items you create before 
checking them in to a Desk. You'll also be able to check items out from other 
Desks to edit them at your Workspace.<br>
<br>
Click My Workspace in the upper left hand corner to return to this screen at any 
time.<br>
<h2>Content Items</h2>
You can manage three different types of content in your Workspace: Media, Stories, 
and Templates. Newly created content items will reside in your Workspace until 
you move them -or check them in- to a Desk.<BR>
<BR>
By checking an item into a Desk, you allow other permitted users to access it. 
Desks are like stations in an assembly line - an item needs to be approved by 
each one before it is ready to ship out to consumers. <BR>
<BR>
For example: let's say you have created a new article for your Website. You check 
it in to the Edit Desk, where an editor examines its structure and accuracy. The 
editor then checks the article in to the Legal Desk, where a lawyer makes sure 
it will not get you sued. Next it goes to the Copy Desk, to be scrutinized for 
grammar and spelling. And finally, it is checked in to the Publish Desk, where 
you can push it to the site. <BR>
<BR>
At each of these points, the person who needs to edit the item will check it out, 
or move it to his or her Workspace. When an item on a Desk is checked out to a 
user, it remains listed on that Desk and other users can still view it, but only 
the person who has checked it out can edit it. <BR>
