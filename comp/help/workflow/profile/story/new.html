<h2>New Story</h2>
Use this tool to create Stories for your Website. There are four different types 
of Stories, and each one has several variables and optional elements that you 
can use to control the look of the Story. <BR>
<BR>
<b>Story Types</b> 
<blockquote><b>Article: </b>For standard news stories and features.<BR>
  <b>Column:</b> For editorials, news analyses and opinion pieces.<BR>
  <b>Book Review:</b> For reviews. Includes a profile grid to display vital information 
  of the subject being reviewed.<BR>
  <b>Cover: </b>Very different from the other Story Types, the Cover is more of 
  a section or home page which links to multiple Stories.</blockquote>
