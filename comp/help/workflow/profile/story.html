<h2>Story Profile Data</h2>
<h4>1) Information</h4>

<h4>2) Content</h4>
This is where you give shape to the Story, by editing its existing Elements and adding new ones.  Each different Story type has its own set of Elements -- some are automatically included and some are optional.

    sets for each Story type and create new Elements from scratch.</blockquote>

<h4>3) Categories</h4>
Categories determine where on the site an item is published.  An item can lie in one Category or in several, but only one is designated as the Primary Category.

  the circle next to it, then click on Save or Save and Stay at the bottom of

  the Delete button. You can delete more than one Category at a time.</blockquote>

<h4>4) Associations</h4>
In this section, you provide meta information (information that is embedded in the Story but not displayed), which allows for more accurate searches and automated associations between Stories.
<blockquote> <b>Keywords: </b>Enter any words or phrases relating to the Story's 
  subject(s) that will help tie it to related Stories and also allow it to be 
  found by archive searches. Click Edit to get to the Edit Keywords page, then 
  type the keywords into the blanks. You do not need to fill in all four spaces, 
  but you can include as many additional spaces as you want by clicking Add More. 
  When done, click Save.<br>
  <b>Contributors: </b>Enter the names of the item's producers, including the 
  writer and any photographer or illustrator whose work is featured with the Story.

  and click Next. When done, click Save.</blockquote>
