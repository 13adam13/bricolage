<h2>New Media</h2>
Use this tool to generate files for the Media that will be used on your site.  The process is simple: <blockquote>
1.	Create a new file.<BR>
2.	Upload a photograph, graphic or other type of Media to the file. <BR>
3.	Check it into a public Desk for approval.<BR>
4.	Publish it (and relate it to a Story, if desired). </blockquote>

<h3>Create a Media file</h3>
Click New Media from the left navbar and enter the following vital information:
<blockquote> <b>Title: </b>The name of the Media file.<BR>
  <b>Media Type: </b>Choose what kind of Story you are creating.<BR>
  <b>Source: </b>??description pending <BR>
  <b>Category: </b>Where on the site the Media will be published.<BR>
  <b>Priority: </b>Tells users how urgent the Media is. <BR>
  <b>Cover Date:</b> Select the date and time that will be displayed with the 
  Media (this is not necessarily the publish date, but what appears to viewers 
  to be the publish date). </blockquote>

When done, click Create. This brings you to the Media Profile page. <BR>
