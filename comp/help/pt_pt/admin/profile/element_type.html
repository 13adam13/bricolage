<dt>Properties</dt>
<dd>Enter the Element Type's name, key name, and a brief description.
    The key name should be unique, one-word identifier. Choose
    a type of Burner for your templates to use. When adding a new
    Element Type, you can also select the Element Type Set.</dd>

<dt>Group Memberships</dt>
<dd>Groups determine the permission that users will have to
    read, edit, or create Elements Types of this kind. Select a group
    from the 'Available Groups' list and click the 'Add to List'
    button to add it to the 'Current Groups'. You can remove a
    group from the 'Current Groups' by selecting a group and
    clicking 'Remove from List'. If you are creating a new Element Type,
    click the Next button to continue. This will bring you to the
    full Element Type Profile.</dd>

<dt>Sites</dt>
<dd>Top-level elements (story and media type elements) can be shared among several sites.
    This section won't be present for non-top-level elements. The Sites
    section allows you to add or delete sites from the element.
    You can also select the Primary Output Channel for each site.</dd>

<dt>Existing Subelements</dt>
<dd>Elements are really containers for other elements as well as
    data fields. To add subelements to an element, click
    the 'Add Subelement' button to bring up
    the 'Choose Subelements' screen. Use the Search box as usual
    to select all or a subset of the available subelements. Naturally,
    the elements you can select won't include top-level elements.
    To add elements, check their corresponding 'Add to Element'
    checkboxes, then click 'Add Elements'; if you decide you don't
    want to add any subelements, just leave all the checkboxes blank
    and click 'Add Elements'.
    This will bring you back to the Element Type Profile.</dd>

<dt>Custom Fields</dt>
<dd>Fields are where data is stored. Along with subelements,
    these define the structure of an element. In the Custom Fields
    section you can edit the default value for the field. You can
    reorder the elements by selecting a number from the popup menu.
    To edit the field, click the Edit link. This will bring you
    to the Field Profile, where you can change anything
    about the field except its key name and type (text area,
    checkbox, etc.). Finally, to delete a field, check the
    'Delete' checkbox and click one of the Save buttons at
    the bottom.</dd>

<dt>Add New Field</dt>
<dd>This is where you add new fields to the Custom Fields section.
    First, choose the field type from the group of checkboxes on
    the left. Through the magic of JavaScript, this will change
    the available attributes on the right depending on which field
    type you choose. The attributes are explained in detail on
    the <a href="field_type.html">Field Type Profile Help Page</a></dd>

<p>When finished, click <em>Save</em>, or click <em>Save and Stay</em> to save but
   continue editing the Element. Clicking <em>Return</em> will bring you
   back to the Element Type Manager without saving your changes.</p>
