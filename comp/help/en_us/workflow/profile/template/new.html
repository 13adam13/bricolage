<help page="New Template">

<p>Use this tool to customize the output of yoru Bricolage documents. Here you
will create templates generate output from your story docments, increasing
your options and molding the publishing tool to suit your needs.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of templates you can produce:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Element Templates</dt>
<dd>Element templates are related to a specific element or subelement. They
are called when the element is passed to a call to
<code>$burner-&gt;display_element</code> in a template. Each template belongs
to one output channel, so to render a story in three output channels requires
three templates. The exception to this rule is when you make an output channel
include the templates from another output channel.</dd>

<dt>Category Templates</dt>
<dd>Category templates are the default template handler (known as an
autohandler to the Mason burner) for a category in an output channel. Category
templates allow you to <q>wrap</q> text (usually HTML headers and footers)
around the chain of elements burned in that category and its
subcategories.</dd>

<dt>Utility Templates</dt>
<dd>Utility templates contain generic code that can be re-used in other
templates, like validation calls, etc. they can be either output
channel-specific be associated with an output channel specifically created to
contain hold utility templates. In the latter case, make the utility templates
in the utility output channel available to your other output channels by
including the utility output channel in the other output channels.</dt>
