<help page="Super Bulk Edit">

<p>Use the Super Bulk Edit interface to edit all of the fields and subelements
of an element at once. Fields and subelements are demarcated by an equals sign
(=) and the key name of the field or subelement. Field tags are followed by an
empty line, and then the text of that field. The field text is assumed to
contain no empty lines itself. Subelement tags exist by themselves on a line,
but <em>their</em> fields and subelements cannot be directly edited.</p>

<p>For example, to edit an element containing the fields &quot;header&quot;
and &quot;paragraph&quot; and the subelement &quot;inset&quot;, the Super Bulk
Edit syntax might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>=header

This is a header

=paragraph

First paragraph.

=paragraph

Second paragraph.

=inset

=paragraph

Third paragraph.
</code></pre>

<p>To reorder the contents of the element, simply move the contents of the
elements and their corresponding tags to where you need them. For example, if
you wanted to move the header in the above example to after the first
paragraph, simply edit it to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>=paragraph

First paragraph.

=header

This is a header

=paragraph

Second paragraph.

=inset

=paragraph

Third paragraph.
</code></pre>

<p>To save space and make editing simpler, you may choose a &quot;Default
Element&quot; for which no tag is necessary. For example, if
&quot;paragraph&quot; was selected as the default element, the above example
would be re-rendered like this:</p>

<pre><code>First paragraph.

=header

This is a header

Second paragraph.

=inset

Third paragraph.
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, note that empty fields still need to contain a blank line
indicating the empty field. For example, if the above sample element contained
an &quot;link_text&quot; field that had no text in it, it would be displayed
like so:</p>

<pre><code>First paragraph.

=header

This is a header

=link_text



Second paragraph.

=inset

Third paragraph.
</code></pre>

<p>Note the extra empty lines after the <code>=link_text</code> tag. This
syntax is necessary for Bricolage to recognize that the field does exist, but
contains no data.</p>
