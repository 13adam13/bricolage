the current workflow and check them out. Click <q>Advanced Search</q>

<dt>Simple Search</dt>
<dd>The default search is very simple: just enter a title, URL or keyword and
    click <em>Search.</em> Enter <q>%</q> to search for <em>all</em> media
    documents. Use SQL <code>LIKE</code> wildcards such as <q>%</q> to
    generalize your search.</dd>

<dt>Advanced Search</dt>
<dd>This search allows you to be more specific about the media you're trying
    to find. Fill in any or all of the fields and click <em>Search.</em> To
    restart your search with a fresh page, click <em>Clear Values.</em></dd>

<dt>Media Found</dt>
<dd>Click <em>View</em> next to the desired media to view its profile. If the
    media document is not checked out to another user or in a different
    workflow, select the <q>Checkout<q> checkbox and click
    the <em>Checkout</em> button at the bottom of the page to check out the
    media document and move it to your workspace. If you have already checked
    it out, click <em>Edit</em> to access its profile.</dd>

<dt>Create a New Media</dt>
<dd>If you can't find what you need in the existing Media Documents, why not
    create a new one? This link will take you to the <q>New Media</q>
    profile.</dd>
