<help page="Events Log">

<p>The <em>Trail/Log</em> (also known as <q>Story Events</q>)
 for a Bricolage object shows a history of events
 associated with it. By default the story's events are filtered by
 <em>Story Moved to Desk</em>, which shows the story's trail through
 a workflow. The <em>Show all</em> link switches the view to show the
 story's complete log of events, such as when it was created, saved,
 or deleted. The <em>Customize</em> link can be used to limit the log
 to show only certain types of events.</p>

<p>The table of events has the following columns:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Name</dt>
 <dd>The type of event which occurred.</dd>

 <dt>Triggered By</dt>
 <dd>The name of the user who caused the event to happen.</dd>

 <dt>Timestamp</dt>
 <dd>The date and time at which the event took place.</dd>

 <dt>Attributes</dt>
 <dd>Any other information that was recorded about the event.  For example,
  when the event records an asset being moved to a different desk this
  column will give the name of the desk it was moved to.</dd>
</dl>

<p>By default the events are shown in date order, starting with the most recent
 events. Click on the title for one of the columns in the table to change
 the ordering.</p>
