<help page="Workflow Manager">

<p>Here is where you create and edit Workflows, the management areas for content
   items. You can add new Workflows or change the existing ones to fit your 
   site's needs.
</p>
<p>Workflows organize the Content creation and editing process among a series of 
   Desks. Every Workflow has one start Desk where all Content enters the Workflow. 
   A Workflow also has one or more Publish Desks, from where Content can be sent to
   the Web Server. Content can be moved back and forth between Desks, the Shelf, 
   and the Web Server. Workflows have two sections &ndash; Actions and Desks. 
   Workflows are the drop down boxes on the left side of the screen.
