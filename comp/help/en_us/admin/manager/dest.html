<help page="Destination Manager">

<p>Here is where you create and edit Destinations,
or in other words the servers where you want your content
moved to after they are published. Note that publishing
and moving (or in general, Actions) are done in separate phases.
Publishing runs the content of elements through
templates (this is called &quot;burning&quot;), storing the resulting
files (usually HTML) to a local staging directory.
Then later the &quot;distribution monitor&quot;, bric_dist_mon,
causes the burned files to be moved from the staging
directory to destination servers.</p>
