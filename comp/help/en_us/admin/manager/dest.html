<help page="Destination Manager">

<p>Here is where you create and edit Destinations,
which are the servers you want your content
distributed to when it is published or previewed. Note that publishing
and moving (or in general, Actions) are done in separate phases.
Publishing runs the content of elements through
templates (this is called <q>burning</q>), storing the resulting
files (usually HTML) to a local staging directory.
Then later the <q>distribution monitor,</q> <code>bric_dist_mon</code>,
causes the burned files to be moved from the staging
directory to destination servers.</p>
