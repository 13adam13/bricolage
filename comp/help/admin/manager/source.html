<h3>Sources</h3>
A Source is the party responsible for providing a certain content item.  Partner sites, your own site, freelancers and news services are just a few examples of potential Sources. On first use, you will find only one Source in the system. This one, temporarily entitled "Internal Source," will be used to attribute content items to your site.  You are encouraged to rename this Source with your company's name and to add any Sources from which you will receive content.  Once you have created a Source, you can give it credit by selecting it from a content item's Profile page.
<blockquote> <b>Search:</b> Searches Sources by name. Do a blank search to list
