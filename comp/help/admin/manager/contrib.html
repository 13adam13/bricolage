<h3>Contributors </h3>
The people who produce content items, Contributors are important to note for the purposes of both attribution and organization.  By adding Contributors in this area and later attaching them to content items, not only can you keep tabs on who did what, but you can also tie together stories created by the same writer or allow visitors to search illustrations by an artist.
