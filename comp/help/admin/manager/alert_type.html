<help page="Alert Type Manager">

<p>Here you can tell Bricolage to send you messages, or Alerts, when certain
actions are carried out. For example, if you have submitted a new Story to be
published next Tuesday, you can have Bricolage send you an Alert as soon as it
goes up to let you know that the action has been executed.</p>
