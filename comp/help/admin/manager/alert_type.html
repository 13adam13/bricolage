<h3>Alert Types</h3>
Here you can tell Bricolage to send you messages, or Alerts, when certain actions are carried out.  For example, if you have submitted a new Story to be published next Tuesday, you can have Bricolage send you an Alert as soon as it goes up to let you know that the action has been executed.
