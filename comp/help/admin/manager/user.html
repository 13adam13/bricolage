<h3>Users</h3>
This is where you create user accounts and establish access levels.  A user's access is determined by his or her membership in administrative Groups.  For example, if you want user Mary Jones to be allowed to edit stories, you'll go to her User Profile page and enter her into an admin Group that has story editing permissions. 
<blockquote> <b>Search:</b> Searches active users by last name. Do a blank search 
  to list all active users. <BR>
  <b>Add a New User:</b> Click this button to create a new user account. It brings 
  you to the User Profile page. Enter the requested information and then click 
  Save at the bottom of the page. <BR>
  <b>Existing Users:</b> Click Edit to modify a person's User Profile. Click Log 
  to view the account's history of actions. To delete a user account, check the 
  Delete box, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Delete Checked button.
