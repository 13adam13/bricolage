<dd>Enter the Output Channel's name and a brief description. With the Pre and
    Post fields, you can tell the Output Channel to associate a prefix directory
    or postfix directory to the URI of all resources (stories and media) in that
    Output Channel. This is useful if you're keeping different kinds of content
    on one delivery server. Enter the file name and extension in the bottom two
    fields.</dd>

<dd>Select existing Output Channels in order to include the templates of those
    Output Channels in this Output Channel. The idea here is that, when you
    preview or publish assets via this Output Channel, if the Burn system can't
    find a template, it'll look for it in the Output Channels selected here. The
    template includes can be ordered, and they will be searched for templates in
    that order.</dd>
