<h3>Output Channel Profile</h3>
Enter the Output Channel's name, a brief description.  With the Pre and Post fields, you can tell the Output Channel to associate a prefix directory or postfix directory to the URI of all resources (stories and media) in that Output Channel. This is useful if you're keeping different kinds of content on one delivery server.  Enter the file name and extension in the bottom two fields.  Click Save when finished.
