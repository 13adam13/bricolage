Bricolage Debian README
-----------------------

Bricolage has been tested on Debian's testing distribution (3.0).  The
current stable Debian (2.2) will not work with Bricolage as it does
not include Perl 5.6.

The following DEBs should be installed with apt-get before installing
Bricolage:

  apache-perl
  apache-dev
  postgresql
  postgresql-dev
  expat
  unzip
