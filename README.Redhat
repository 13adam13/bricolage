Bricolage Redhat README
-----------------------

Bricolage works well on Redhat Linux, but installing components from
RPM requires some care.  If you are installing Bricolage's
requirements from source you can skip these notes and proceed directly
to INSTALL.

RPM notes:

  - You must install the PostgreSQL server and devel RPMs in
    order for Bricolage to find PostgreSQL.  This is because the devel
    RPMs contain the pg_config binary that Bricolage uses to find
    PostgreSQL.
