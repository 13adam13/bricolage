# APACHE_CONF (using Listen, Port, or BindAddress). SSL_ENABLE turns on SSL
# support. Note that if SSL_ENABLE is turned on, then LISTEN_PORT *must* be 80,

# environment variable set before starting the application. $BRICOLAGE_ROOT
# defaults to '/usr/local/bricolage' if it's not set, so if you have Bricolage

# in the template name space. The default is not to include the XML::Writer
# object. The XML_WRITER_ARGS directive passes arguments to the instantiation of
# the XML::Writer object, should INCLUDE_XML_WRITER be switched on. All the
# arguments specified by the XML::Writer documentation for the new() method may
# be used except the OUTPUT argument, which Bricolage handles so that the output

# Authentication settings. AUTH_TTL is the amount of time, in seconds, a user is

# Character translation settings. CHAR_SET is the character set of in which data

# Distribution settings. ENABLE_DIST, if set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', tells the
# API that the distribution engine can distribute resources within the local
# application process. If ENABLE_DIST is any other value, it is assumed that the
# distribution Engine is running elsewhere. The default is '1' if ENABLE_DIST is
# unspecified. DIST_ATTEMPTS tells the distribution engine how many times to
# attempt to distribute a resource before giving up. The default is 3.
# PREVIEW_LOCAL tells Bricolage to preview stories from its own Apache process.
# If set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', it will use its own process for previewing.
# Otherwise, it will use a server from a destination with the "Preview" checkbox
# checked for previews. If PREVIEW_LOCAL is active, you must be sure that
# SYS_USER has write access to MASON_COMP_ROOT/preview. The default is "1".
# PREVIEW_MASON tells Bricolage to use Mason for local previews. Only set this
# directive to true if the files you create with your Templates contain Mason
# code. This directive has no effect unless PREVIEW_LOCAL is active. The default
# is "0". DEF_MEDIA_TYPE designates the default media type for assets where
# Bricolage cannot ascertain the media type. Defaults to "text/html" if not
# specified. ENABLE_SFTP_MOVER, if set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', tells the API
# that the distribution engine can distribute resources by SFTP. The default
# is 0 if unspecified. Using the SFTP mover requires some manual installation;
# see lib/Bric/Admin.pod for details.

# Alert Settings. ALERT_FROM is the email address that will appear in the 'From'
# header of alerts emailed to users. ALERT_TO_METH specifies which header to
# use for identifying alert recipients. Use 'to' if you want everyone who
# receives the same alert to see who else received it. Use 'bcc' if you don't
# want anyone to see who else got an alert, or if you just want to save the

# Apache child process is checked, before its mortality is questioned, and how
# large it may grow before it is killed. Processes which grow to be larger than
# MAX_PROCESS_SIZE will be killed after #CHECK_FREQUENCY requests are handled by
# the said process. MIN_SHARE_SIZE Indicates the minimum amount of shared memory
# the process must employ to not be considered a candidate for termination. 
# MAX_UNSHARED_SIZE Sets a limit on the amount of unshared memory a process may
# consume to not be a candidate for termination. Set MIN_SHARE_SIZE or

# Full search setting. By default, Bricolage looks for search strings in the
# database only at the beginning of the fields. The reason for this is that, if
# it looks for the search string anywhere within the result fields, it cannot
# #use any database indexes, and therefore could be much slower. But it depends
# on #how many records there are. Set this configuration directive to "On" or
# "Yes" or #"1" if you wish to enable the slower subsearch approach -- if, for
# example, you don't have many records in your database.

# Output Channel file naming settings. All files burned to the file system must

# Extension" properties of the Output Channel they're getting burned to. You
# can give these properties whatever values you want (as long as they're legal
# on your file system!), but here you can set some defaults that all Output
# channels will start with. DEFAULT_FILENAME will default to 'index' and
# DEFAULT_FILE_EXT will default to 'html' if you don't set them here.
