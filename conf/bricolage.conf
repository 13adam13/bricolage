# environment variable set before starting the application. $BRICOLAGE_ROOT
# defaults to '/usr/local/bricolage' if it's not set, so if you have Bricolage

# Burner settings. The BURN_ROOT directive specifies the location of Bricolage
# templates and the files output upon publishing or previewing content. The
# default is MASON_DATA_ROOT/burn. The INCLUDE_XML_WRITER directive causes the
# Bricolage burn system to create and include an XML::Writer object as a global
# in the template name space. The default is not to include the XML::Writer
# object. The XML_WRITER_ARGS directive passes arguments to the instantiation of
# the XML::Writer object, should INCLUDE_XML_WRITER be switched on. All the
# arguments specified by the XML::Writer documentation for the new() method may
# be used except the OUTPUT argument, which Bricolage handles so that the output
# is sent to the same place as template Mason code sends its content. Defaults

# Authentication settings. AUTH_TTL is the amount of time, in seconds, a user is

# hours (28800 seconds). AUTH_SECRET is a random string that's used to encrypt
# the authentication cookie information in a double-MD5 hashing scheme. It's a
# good idea to change this value periodically so that anyone who might have seen
# it before can't reverse-engineer the authentication cookie.

# Character translation settings. CHAR_SET is the character set of in which data
# will be passed to the API. ISO-8859-1 should work for most Western European
# users. Note that this setting is necessary as all data is stored in the

# Distribution settings. ENABLE_DIST, if set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', tells the
# API that the distribution engine can distribute resources within the local
# application process. If ENABLE_DIST is any other value, it is assumed that the
# distribution Engine is running elsewhere. The default is '1' if ENABLE_DIST is
# unspecified. DIST_ATTEMPTS tells the distribution engine how many times to
# attempt to distribute a resource before giving up. The default is 3.
# PREVIEW_LOCAL tells Bricolage to preview stories from its own Apache process.
# If set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', it will use its own process for previewing.
# Otherwise, it will use a server from a destination with the "Preview" checkbox
# checked for previews. If PREVIEW_LOCAL is active, you must be sure that
# SYS_USER has write access to MASON_COMP_ROOT/preview. The default is "1". *
# PREVIEW_MASON tells Bricolage to use Mason for local previews. Only set this
# directive to true if the files you create with your Templates contain Mason
# code. This directive has no effect unless PREVIEW_LOCAL is active. The default
# is "0".

# Alert Settings. ALERT_FROM is the email address that will appear in the 'From'
# header of alerts emailed to users. ALERT_TO_METH specifieds which header to
# use for identifying alert recipients. Use 'to' if you want everyone who
# receives the same alert to see who else received it. Use 'bcc' if you don't
# want anyone to see who else got an alert, or if you just want to save the
# bandwidth. Defaults to 'bcc'.

# Full search setting. By default, Bricolage looks for search strings in the
# database only at the beginning of the fields. The reason for this is that, if
# it looks for the search string anywhere within the result fields, it cannot
# #use any database indexes, and therefore could be much slower. But it depends
# on #how many records there are. Set this configuration directive to "On" or
# "Yes" or #"1" if you wish to enable the slower subsearch approach -- if, for
# example, you don't have many records in your database.

# Output Channel file naming settings. All files burned to the file system must
# be named (of course!), and they're named for the "File Name" and "File
# Extenstion" properties of the Output Channel they're getting burned to. You
# can give these properties whatever values you want (as long as they're legal
# on your file system!), but here you can set some defaults that all Output
# channels will start with. DEFAULT_FILENAME will default to 'index' and
# DEFAULT_FILE_EXT will default to 'html' if you don't set them here.
