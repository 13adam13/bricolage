# specified in APACHE_CONF (using Listen, Port, or BindAddress). SSL_ENABLE
# defines the type of SSL support available (Off, mod_ssl, apache_ssl).
# SSL_PORT defines the port Bricolage will listen to for https server. It
# defaults to 443. ALWAYS_USE_SSL defaults to off if not set. It forces
# Bricolage to always use ssl for user connections and does not give the user
# the option of just using SSL for login. NAME_VHOST is the IP address on
# which the virtual host name specified in the VHOST_SERVER_NAME directive
# will respond. If you change the LISTEN_PORT and/or SSL_PORT numbers,
# remember to also change them in httpd.conf and visa versa.

# unspecified. DIST_ATTEMPTS tells the distribution engine how many times to
# attempt to distribute a resource before giving up. The default is 3.
# PREVIEW_LOCAL tells Bricolage to preview stories from its own Apache process.
# If set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', it will use its own process for previewing.
# Otherwise, it will use a server from a destination with the "Preview" checkbox
# checked for previews. If PREVIEW_LOCAL is active, you must be sure that
# SYS_USER has write access to MASON_COMP_ROOT/preview. The default is "1".
# PREVIEW_MASON tells Bricolage to use Mason for local previews. Only set this
# directive to true if the files you create with your Templates contain Mason
# code. This directive has no effect unless PREVIEW_LOCAL is active. The default
# is "0". DEF_MEDIA_TYPE designates the default media type for assets where
# Bricolage cannot ascertain the media type. Defaults to "text/html" if not
# specified. Set ENABLE_SFTP_MOVER or ENABLE_WEBDAV_MOVER to 'yes' or 'on' or
# 1, to tell the API that the distribution engine can distribute resources
# by SFTP or by the WebDAV protocol. The default is 0 if unspecified. Using

# Full search setting. By default, Bricolage looks for search strings in the
