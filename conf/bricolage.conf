# Authentication settings. AUTH_TTL is the amount of time, in seconds, a user

# encrypt the authentication cookie information in a double-MD5 hashing
# scheme. It's a good idea to change this value periodically so that anyone
# who might have seen it before can't reverse-engineer the authentication
# cookie. AUTH_ENGINES is a space-delimited list of the authentication engines
# to use when a user logs in. Each engine will be tried in the order listed.
# Possible values are "Internal" and "LDAP". The default is "Internal". The
# LOGIN_LENGTH and PASSWD_LENGTH settings specify the minimum length of a user

# LDAP settings. If "ldap" is one of the options in the AUTH_ENGINES

# values other than "0", they will be used to connect to the LDAP server to
# search for the user. Otherwise, Bricolage will bind as an anonymous user.
# LDAP_BASE is the DN that will be used as the base for the search for the
# user. LDAP_UID_ATTR identifies the attribute of the LDAP record that
# contains the user name. Set LDAP_FILTER to a an extra filter for searching
# for the user record. If you want to allow only the members of a particular
# group to access Bricolage, set LDAP_GROUP to the DN of the group, and set
# LDAP_MEMBER_ATTR so the name of the attribute identifying each member of the
# group. Enable LDAP_TLS if your LDAP server supports TLS and you wish to use

# Distribution settings. ENABLE_DIST, if set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', tells
# the API that the distribution engine can distribute resources within the
# local application process. If ENABLE_DIST is any other value, it is assumed
# that the distribution Engine is running elsewhere. The default is '1' if
# ENABLE_DIST is unspecified. DIST_ATTEMPTS tells the distribution engine how
# many times to attempt to distribute a resource before giving up. The default
# is 3. PREVIEW_LOCAL tells Bricolage to preview stories from its own Apache
# process. If set to 'yes' or 'on' or '1', it will use its own process for
# previewing. Otherwise, it will use a server from a destination with the
# "Preview" checkbox checked for previews.
#
# If PREVIEW_LOCAL is active, you must be sure that SYS_USER has write access
# to MASON_COMP_ROOT/data/preview. The default is "1". PREVIEW_MASON tells
# Bricolage to use Mason for local previews. Only enable this directive if
# the files you create with your Templates contain Mason code. This directive
# has no effect unless PREVIEW_LOCAL is active. Disabled by
# default. DEF_MEDIA_TYPE designates the default media type for assets where
# Bricolage cannot ascertain the media type. Defaults to "text/html" if not
# specified.
#
# Set ENABLE_SFTP_MOVER or ENABLE_WEBDAV_MOVER to 'yes' or 'on' or 1, to tell
# the API that the distribution engine can distribute resources by SFTP or by
# the WebDAV protocol. Both are disabled by default. Using either the SFTP or
# the WebDAV mover requires some manual installation; perldoc Bric::Admin for
# details. If you enable SFTP, set SFTP_HOME to a directory containing your
# SSH keys and with permisssions appropriate for SYS_USER to access. Setting
# ENABLE_SFTP_V2 to 'yes' will cause the SFTP mover to try SSH protocol 2
# before protocol 1; otherwise, it first tries protocol 1. Setting
# SFTP_MOVER_CIPHER will force the SFTP mover to use that cipher when
# distributing resources via SFTP. Consult the Net::SSH::Perl documentation
# for a current list of ciphers. If it is set to 0, the default cipher will be
# used.
#
# QUEUE_PUBLISH_JOBS tells Bricolage to drop all jobs into the Distribution
# queue on publish, rather than trying to run them immediately, which is the
# default.
#
# FTP_UNLINK_BEFORE_MOVE must be set to Yes for some FTP servers (e.g.
# pure-ftpd has been reported to need this) to correctly handle uploads of
# already existing files: when publishing via FTP, Bricolage first creates a
# temporary file, than moves this temp file over the existing, older file,

# memory the process must employ to not be considered a candidate for
# termination. MAX_UNSHARED_SIZE Sets a limit on the amount of unshared memory
# a process may consume to not be a candidate for termination. Set

# Workflow desk transfers. By default, a desk that is shared between workflows

PUBLISH_RELATED_ASSETS  = Yes

# When PUBLISH_RELATED_ASSETS is enabled, the publish process will fail if any

# FTP settings. ENABLE_FTP_SERVER enables the Bricolage virtual server, which
# can be used to edit, update, and deploy templates by uploading them via
# FTP. This requires running the bin/bric_ftpd script, as well. Disabled by
# default. FTP_DEPLOY_ON_UPLOAD forces the FTP server to deploy templates as
# soon as they're uploaded to the FTP server. By default, this is not the
# behavior; temlates are simply put into the user's workspace and template
# sandbox when uploaded, unless they're uploaded with ".deploy" appended to
# their file names. Assign an IP address to FTP_ADDRESS to force the FTP
# server to listen only on that address; by default the FTP server will listen
# on all local IP addresses. FTP_PORT is the port that the FTP server will
# listen on. Defaults to 2121 if not specified. FTP_DEBUG forces the FTP
# server to write a lote of debugging data to its log. Enable this directive
# and tail the log if your FTP server is acting up. FTP_LOG specifies the
# location of the FTP log. Defaults to $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/ftp.log if not
# specified. FTP_PID_FILE specifies the location of the file storing the FTP
# server's PID, which will then be used to shut down the FTP server. Defaults

## WYSIWYG CONFIGURATION

# editors, you will need to download and install (read: untar) the editors 
# yourself.  Download the latest version from the URLs below and extract them
# into the corresponding folders.
