Bric::Mech

This is a subclass of WWW::Mechanize which provides convenience
methods for navigating the Bricolage (content management system)
browser interface. In other words, it makes it easier to write
Bricolage scripts.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Most of the tests will be skipped unless you have set the following
environment variables:

  BRICOLAGE_SERVER
  BRICOLAGE_USERNAME
  BRICOLAGE_PASSWORD

and a Bricolage server is running. These rudimentary tests
will make no database changes.
