Bric::Mech

This is a subclass of WWW::Mechanize which provides convenience
methods for navigating the Bricolage (content management system)
browser interface. In other words, it makes it easier to write
Bricolage scripts. In particular, I want to use it to write UI test
scripts, and possibly to replace bric_soap. Although currently in
contrib, it might get integrated into the "core".


INSTALLATION

To install this module, type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

Most of the tests will be skipped unless you have set the following
environment variables:

  BRICOLAGE_SERVER
  BRICOLAGE_USERNAME
  BRICOLAGE_PASSWORD

and a Bricolage server is running. These tests will make
no database changes. They should pass when run against
any Bricolage (1.10+) installation, though some cases may
fail (for example, if you run as a user with restricted
permissions).

In addition you can run UI tests (in t/UI), which are only
intended for Bricolage developers, with the following:

  ./Build uitest

You should never run this against a production database
because it will modify the database. It assumes that you
have a newly created Bricolage database. See the TESTING
section of Bric::Hacker for how to get a clean database.


MAINTAINER NOTES

The shell script `dist.sh' can be run to test and create
a distribution tarball.
