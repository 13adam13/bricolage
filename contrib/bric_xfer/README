Description:
  o  Use bric_xfer_grps to transfer groups from one bricolage
     installation to another. It assumes that the "group members"
     for the group already exist in the destination bricolage.
     For the special case of User group members, you can use
     the bric_xfer_users script.
Usage:
  o  Read the POD for each script
     $ bric_xfer_grps --man
     $ bric_xfer_grps --help
Notes:
  o  You have to run the scripts as the root user when importing
     so that it can switch to the Apache user (to access cache).
  o  Test on a non-production server. It was only run to transfer
     between versions 1.4.3 and 1.6.0 with User and Category groups.
Todo:
  o  Implement scripts for other group members, e.g. Workflow.
     (Mark has a script to transfer Categories)
