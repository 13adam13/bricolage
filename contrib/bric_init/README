Description:
  o Initializes a new Bricolage installation.
Usage:
  o You should first configure the %conf hash. Then
    run this program as your apache user. Only run it once.
    Note that this program can contain passwords and so is
    a possible security risk.
Bugs:
  o  You have to run this as your apache user (nobody) because
     some things (like saving Preferences) require write
     permission to the cache; alternatively, change the perms
     of /tmp/bricolage/cache and add yourself to apache's group.
  o  It seems that the Story doesn't get checked into the Edit
     desk unless you've already logged in when you run the script.
Todo:
  o  Probably should generalize this to a "bric_admin" tool
     or add some SOAP modules and add functionality to bric_soap.
