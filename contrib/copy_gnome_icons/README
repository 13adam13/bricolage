NAME
    copy_gnome_icons

SYNOPSIS
      copy_gnome_icons *.png

DESCRIPTION
    This script is designed to convert a collection of GNOME MIME type icons
    to the Bricoalge root and to the naming convention used by Bricolage.
    The icons will then be used by the Bricolage UI, assuming that the
    "USE_THUMBNAILS" bricolage.conf directive has been enabled.

    Be sure to set the $BRICOLAGE_ROOT environment variable if it is
    anything other than /usr/local/bricolage. The icons will bee installed
    into the comp/media/mime directory under the Bricolage root.

    The icons are named exactly as the corresponding MIME types are named,
    with the resulting PNG files installed in appropriate subdirectories.
    For example, an icon named "gnome-text-html.png" will be copied to
    comp/media/mime/text/html.png.

    This script was developed using the GNOME MIME type icons downloaded
    from <http://developer.ximian.com/images/art-devel/mime-icons.tgz>.
    Updates happily accepted.
