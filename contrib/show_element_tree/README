Description:
  Prints out elements and their subelements, custom fields, and output
  channels using the output from `bric_soap element export`.

Usage:
  $ bric_soap element list_ids | bric_soap element export - > elements.xml
  $ ./element-tree.pl elements.xml
  See the comments in the script for how to control the display
  of custom fields, output channels, and non top-level elements.

  Display of elements is in the following format:

    Element name (field, repeatable_field*, required_field!, ...)
    . Child element (fields...)
    . . Subchildren (...)
    > Primary output channel, other output channels

Todo:
  Maybe show the description.
  Maybe not show isolated non-top-level elements, like utility templates.

Bugs:
  Output channels are badly handled for version 1.8: the primary OC
  isn't determined, and there is no distinction between sites.
