Description:
  Prints out elements and their subelements and custom fields
  using the output from `bric_soap element export`.

Usage:
  $ bric_soap element list_ids | bric_soap element export - > elements.xml
  $ ./element-tree.pl elements.xml
  See also the comments in the script.

Todo:
  Show output channels for top-level elements.
  Maybe show the description.
  Maybe not show isolated non-top-level elements, like utility templates.
