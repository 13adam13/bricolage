Bricolage is a full-featured, enterprise-class content management system. It
offers a browser-based interface for ease-of use, a full-fledged templating
system with complete programming language support for flexibility, and many
other features. It operates in an Apache/mod_perl environment, and uses the
PostgreSQL RDBMS for its repository.

This the release candidate for Bricolage verion 1.4.0, and is considered
feature-complete. Nearly 50 new features have been added since the 1.2.2
release, and over 80 bugs fixed. Barring any unforseen major bugs cropping up,
1.4.0 will be released within a week of this release. Please feel give it a
try, and report any issues to the Bricolage Bugzilla database, at
