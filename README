                       Bricolage Content Management System

                                 Version 1.7.2

Bricolage is a full-featured, enterprise-class content management system. It
offers a browser-based interface for ease-of use, a full-fledged templating
system with complete programming language support for flexibility, and many
other features. It operates in an Apache/mod_perl environment, and uses the
PostgreSQL RDBMS for its repository.

This is a development release of Bricolage. It contains over 45 new features
not found in Bricolage 1.6.x, including support for multiple sites, aliasing
documents between sites, email distribution, keyword management, Template
Toolkit templating, search by field contents, and many performance and UI
enhancements. See Changes for a complete list of changes.

Be warned that, as a development release of Bricolage, this version will have
bugs. We welcome people testing this release, but anyone using Bricolage in a
production environment is strongly encouraged to await the arrival of 1.8.0,
likely in late October or early November.

KNOWN ISSUES
============

* Apache 1.3.28 does not work properly with Bricolage. It causes the
  connections to the PostgreSQL server to be unexpectedly dropped in such a
  way that Bricolage cannot reconnect. Please use Apache 1.3.27 until the
  underlying problem has been identified and addressed. Join the
  Bricolage-General mail list to receive updates on the status of this issue,
  or follow the Apache bug report.

    http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22805

* Users who have been given the rights, via membership, to edit groups and/or
  users effectively have complete access to the system. This is because they
  can add themselves to any group they want, including "Global Admins."
  Solving this problem is harder than it looks, due to the Bricolage
  permissions architecture design. The solution is to give only those you
  trust to have "Global Admin" access permission to edit users and/or
  groups. Complete details are available via the Bugzilla bug report at
  http://bugzilla.bricolage.cc/show_bug.cgi?id=93.

Enjoy!
